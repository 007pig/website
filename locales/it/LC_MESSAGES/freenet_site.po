"Freenet is free software which lets you anonymously share files, browse and\n"
"publish \"freesites\" (web sites accessible only through Freenet) and chat on\n"
"forums, without fear of censorship. Freenet is decentralised to make it less\n"

"their friends, is very difficult to detect."

"Files are encrypted, so generally the user cannot easily discover what is in\n"

"\n"
"Freedom of speech, in most western cultures, is generally considered to be one\n"

"share ideas and opinions so important? There are several ways to answer this\n"

"#### 3.1 Communication is what makes us human\n"
"\n"
"One of the most obvious differences between mankind and the rest of the animal\n"
"kingdom is our ability to communicate sophisticated and abstract concepts. While\n"
"we constantly discover that animal's communication ability is more sophisticated\n"
"than previously assumed, it is unlikely that any other animal approaches our own\n"
"level of ability in this area."

"#### 3.2 Knowledge is good\n"
"\n"
"Most people, given the option of knowing something and not knowing something,\n"
"will choose to have more information rather than less. Wars have been won and\n"

"#### 3.3 Democracy assumes a well informed population\n"
"\n"
"Many people today live under democratic governments, and those who don't,\n"
"probably want to. Democracy is an answer to the question of how to create\n"
"leaders, while preventing them from abusing that power. It achieves this by\n"
"giving the population the power to regulate their government through voting,\n"
"yet the ability to vote does not necessarily mean that you live in a\n"
"democratic country. For a population to regulate their government effectively\n"
"it must know what their government is doing, they must be well informed. It\n"
"is a feedback loop, but this loop can be broken if the government has the\n"
"power to control the information the population has access to."

"### 4\\. Censorship and freedom\n"
"\n"
"Everyone values their freedom, in fact, many consider it so important that\n"
"they will die for it. People like to think that they are free to form and\n"
"hold whatever opinions they like, particularly in western countries. Consider\n"
"now that someone had the ability to control the information you have access\n"
"to. This would give them the ability to manipulate your opinions by hiding\n"
"some facts from you, by presenting you with lies and censoring anything that\n"
"contradicted those lies. This is not some Orwellian fiction, it is standard\n"
"practice for most western governments to lie to their populations, so much\n"
"so, that people now take it for granted, despite the fact that this\n"
"undermines the very democratic principles which justify the government's\n"
"existence in the first place."
msgstr ""

#: pages/about.py:158
msgid ""
"### 5\\. The solution\n"
"\n"
"The only way to ensure that a democracy will remain effective is to ensure\n"
"that the government cannot control its population's ability to share\n"
"information, to communicate. So long as everything we see and hear is\n"
"filtered, we are not truly free. Freenet's aim is to allow two or more people\n"
"who wish to share information, to do so."
msgstr ""

#: pages/about.py:167
msgid ""
"### 6\\. Isn't censorship sometimes necessary?\n"
"\n"
"Of course no issue is black and white, and there are many who feel that\n"
"censorship is a good thing in some circumstances. For example, in some\n"
"European countries propagating information deemed to be racist is illegal.\n"
"Governments seek to prevent people from advocating ideas which are deemed\n"
"damaging to society. There are two answers to this however. The first is that\n"
"you can't allow those in power to impose \"good\" censorship, without also\n"
"enabling them to impose \"bad\" censorship. To impose any form of censorship a\n"
"government must have the ability to monitor and thus restrict communication.\n"
"There are already criticisms that the anti-racism censorship in many European\n"
"countries is hampering legitimate historical analysis of events such as the\n"
"second world war.\n"
"\n"
"The second argument is that this \"good\" censorship is counter-productive even\n"
"when it does not leak into other areas. For example, it is generally more\n"
"effective when trying to persuade someone of something to present them with\n"
"the arguments against it, and then answer those arguments. Unfortunately,\n"
"preventing people from being aware of the often sophisticated arguments used\n"
"by racists, makes them vulnerable to those arguments when they do eventually\n"
"encounter them.\n"
"\n"
"Of course the first argument is the stronger one, and would still hold-true\n"
"even if you didn't accept the second. Basically, you either have censorship,\n"
"or you don't. There is no middle-ground."
msgstr ""

#: pages/about.py:194
msgid ""
"### 7\\. But why is anonymity necessary?\n"
"\n"
"You cannot have freedom of speech without the option to remain anonymous.\n"
"Most censorship is retrospective, it is generally much easier to curtail free\n"
"speech by punishing those who exercise it afterward, rather than preventing\n"
"them from doing it in the first place. The only way to prevent this is to\n"
"remain anonymous. It is a common misconception that you cannot trust\n"
"anonymous information. This is not necessarily true, using digital signatures\n"
"people can create a secure anonymous pseudonym which, in time, people can\n"
"learn to trust. Freenet incorporates a mechanism called \"subspaces\" to\n"
"facilitate this."
msgstr ""

#: pages/about.py:207
msgid ""
"### 8\\. And what of copyright?\n"
"\n"
"Of course much of Freenet's publicity has centered around the issue of\n"
"copyright, and thus I will speak to it briefly. The core problem with\n"
"copyright is that enforcement of it requires monitoring of communications,\n"
"and you cannot be guaranteed free speech if someone is monitoring everything\n"
"you say. This is important, most people fail to see or address this point\n"
"when debating the issue of copyright, so let me make it clear:\n"
"\n"
"> *You cannot guarantee freedom of speech and enforce copyright law*\n"
"\n"
"It is for this reason that Freenet, a system designed to protect Freedom of\n"
"Speech, must prevent enforcement of copyright."
msgstr ""

#: pages/about.py:222
msgid ""
"### 9\\. But how will artists be rewarded for their work without copyright?\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, even if copyright were the only way that artists could be rewarded\n"
"for their work, then I would contend that freedom is more important than\n"
"having professional artists (those who claim that we would have no art do not\n"
"understand creativity: people will always create, it is a compulsion,\n"
"the only question is whether they can do it for a living).\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, it could be questioned whether copyright is effective even now. The\n"
"music industry is one of the most vocally opposed to enhancements in\n"
"communication technology, yet according to many of the artists who should be\n"
"rewarded by copyright, it is failing to do so. Rather it has allowed\n"
"middle-men to gain control over the mechanisms of distribution, to the\n"
"detriment of both artists and the public."
msgstr ""

#: pages/about.py:238
msgid ""
"### 10\\. Alternatives to Copyright\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately it won't come to this. There are many alternative ways to reward\n"
"artists. The simplest is voluntary payment. This is an extension of the\n"
"patronage system which was frequently used to reward artists prior to\n"
"copyright, where a wealthy person would fund an artist to allow them to\n"
"create full-time. The Internet permits an interesting extension of this idea,\n"
"where rather than having just one wealthy patron, you could have hundreds of\n"
"thousands, contributing small amounts of money over the Internet.\n"
"\n"
"We actually practice what we preach in this regard too, on the 15th of March\n"
"2001 the Freenet Project started taking donations, and within a week we had\n"
"collected over $1000."

"### How Signed Subspace Keys work\n"
"\n"
"* The author generates a cryptographic keypair: a **private key** for signing\n"
"files and a **public key** for verifying the signature.\n"
"* The author also generates a single **symmetric key** (one that is used for\n"
"both encrypting and decrypting).\n"
"* When a file is inserted into Freenet, it is encrypted with the **symmetric\n"
"key** and signed with the **private key**. The signature is stored with the\n"
"file. Nodes don't store the **symmetric key**, only the **public key** part of\n"
"the SSK, as an index to the data. This is so they can plausibly deny knowledge\n"
"of the data on their node.\n"
"\n"
"The SSK is made up of a hash of the public key, and the symmetric key. The\n"
"hash of the public key acts as the index to the data for searching purposes.\n"
"Also, the actual public key is stored with the data. This is so that Freenet\n"
"nodes can verify the signature when the SSK file comes into their node,\n"
"and also so that clients can verify the signature when retrieving the file.\n"
"The symmetric key is so that clients can decrypt the file.\n"
"\n"
"Signed Subspace Key sites have largely been superseded by Updatable Subspace\n"
"Key (USK) sites, which are based on SSKs but allow for links that try to\n"
"always retrieve the most up-to-date version of the site."

"### Updateable Subspace Keys\n"
"\n"
"Updateable Subspace Keys are useful for linking to the latest version of a\n"

"user-friendly wrapper around SSKs, which hide the process of searching for\n"
"more recent versions of a site.\n"
"\n"
"A typical USK key looks like this:\n"
"\n"
"USK@public key hash,decryption key,crypto settings/user selected name/number/\n"
"\n"
"It is almost identical to the Signed Subspace Key, with the exception of the\n"

"*   an USK with a negative number at the end."
msgstr ""

#: pages/documentation.py:530

"The USK with a **positive** number at the end works like this: the Freenet\n"
"node on your computer keeps a list of versions of USKs that it knows about,\n"

"previous visits, and also background requests from previous visits to these\n"

"have the advantage that when you load one page you load all the files on the\n"
"freesite, so either it loads in its entirety or it doesn't load at all,\n"

"Freenet has a different threat model to Tor and the Mixmaster remailers.\n"
"Freenet is designed to resist censorship: The network must therefore be\n"
"robust, and content must be distributed without requiring a central server,\n"
"whether anonymous or not. Anonymity is important for requesters and\n"
"especially for those who upload content in the first place. The typical\n"
"example is a corporate or government whistleblower. Generally to find the\n"
"originator of some content, the attacker must be able to predict the data in\n"
"advance, must be able to move across the network relatively quickly, and must\n"
"be able to perform the attack while the data is being inserted; after that,\n"
"it is distributed across the network and is much harder to trace, and the\n"
"originator may have left the network. However, if by chance or by\n"
"overwhelming force the attacker is connected to the whistleblower (or e.g.\n"
"seizes the computers of everyone on the network), he may be able to identify\n"
"this much more quickly. All of this is vastly more difficult on a darknet,\n"
"where everyone connects only to their friends, where it is very hard for an\n"
"attacker to find nodes, and where to connect to a given node he must social\n"
"engineer its operator! Freenet does support opennet mode (plug and play),\n"
"but darknet is far more secure, and far more difficult to block on a national\n"
"firewall.\n"
"\n"
"Tor on the other hand is designed to anonymise real-time data streams,\n"
"on the assumption that the list of nodes can be public, that there is a free\n"
"world where nodes can be operated safely, that the authors of controversial\n"
"content will be able to either host (hidden) web servers themselves or upload\n"
"it to other (hidden, but usually centralised) storage systems, and so on. And\n"
"Tor has a concept of a \"client\", which is somebody who uses the service\n"
"without providing any value to it; on Freenet, every node relays data for its\n"
"neighbours. Hence the attacks on Freenet are completely different to the\n"
"attacks on Tor. Both compromise to some degree to enable more or less\n"

"Short answer: no.\n"
"\n"
"Long answer:\n"
"\n"
"We don't think so. Aside from protecting freedom of speech, Freenet is also\n"
"designed to be an efficient dynamic caching system. If information is\n"
"requested a lot from a limited number of nodes, the nodes that the requests\n"
"pass through will cache the information, lowering the load on the network. If\n"
"information is inserted on a limited set of nodes and then subsequently\n"
"requested a lot from a separate set of nodes, with repetition, the sets will\n"
"close in on one another in the network topology until they are \"neighbors\"\n"
"and only the originally targeted nodes are suffering from the attack.\n"
"\n"
"In other words, in order to harm Freenet with a flood you need to\n"
"consistently change your point of entry into the network and continually\n"
"insert and request new data, and you will still only increase the workload\n"
"for the network that is linear to your own. Given an immense will and\n"
"capacity greater than the total of the entire network, it is possible to\n"
"cripple any public network (including the Internet itself) with floods,\n"
"but it is our intention to always keep Freenet as resistant to this as\n"
"theoretically possible.\n"
"\n"
"Curiously enough, the above analysis only applies to [Opennet](\n"
"https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Opennet). On Darknet, you might have a little\n"
"more success, although it would be much harder to change your entry point in\n"
"any significant way. Nonetheless, you have a reasonably low bandwidth\n"

"to Live) is a number embedded in each request that is usually\n"
"decremented when the request is forwarded, starting at a value of 18\n"
"at the originator of the request, and serves to limit the number of\n"
"hops a request can survive on the network.  As a security precaution,\n"
"the HTL is decremented probabilistically on the first few hops.  In\n"
"their tracking efforts, the Missouri police department assumes that\n"
"when multiple requests for pieces of a file arrive from a single node,\n"
"and all these requests have HTL 18 with no requests at HTL 17 or 16,\n"
"this node must be the originator of the requests, with a false\n"
"positive probability decreasing with the number of requests received\n"
"from the node.  This would be true if whether the HTL is\n"
"decremented is decided per request, which has historically been the\n"
"case in the early days of Freenet.  The vulnerability they claim to\n"
"exploit was however addressed in 2008 (last touched in [this\n"
"commit][commithtl18]).  Whether the HTL is decremented is since\n"
"decided per connection, so any probability they claim using the\n"
"aforementioned method is false.\n"
"\n"
"For every connection there is a 50% chance that all the HTL 18 requests\n"
"(not only a single one, as would be the case with per-request\n"
"probabilistic decrementing) did not originate from the node from which\n"
"we received them but were forwarded one step. So for 10 connections\n"
"(the lowest number of peers Freenet uses), there are on average 5\n"
"other nodes whose HTL 18 requests are forwarded with HTL 18, so the\n"
"probability that a given HTL 18 request originated at the node from\n"
"which we received it is only about 17% (1 in 6). If the node has more\n"
"connections (close to 30 is common), this probability is even lower. And\n"
"this probability does not get higher when gathering more requests of\n"
"chunks from a specific file or a specific kind of files, because they\n"
"can reasonably all be forwarded from a different node â the one which\n"
"really sent them.\n"
"\n"
"The heterogenity of the network and routing with second-level\n"
"connections taken into account does not easily yield robust\n"
"statistical claims without knowing the peers of peers of the node\n"
"under investigation. Staying connected for a long time might allow for\n"
"distinguishing between the changing peers of the node and requests\n"
"originating at the node itself, but with significant cost.\n"
"\n"
"If the node which is tracked has friend-to-friend peers\n"
"(which unlike automatically added peers do not change regularly), even waiting\n"
"will not allow finding out with the described method whether HTL 18 requests came from the\n"
"node itself or from the peers connected over\n"
"friend-to-friend connections.\n"
"\n"
"For details, see [the code][codehtl18].\n"
"\n"
"This does not make it impossible to track Freenet users who use only\n"
"Opennet mode (connecting to strangers), since a network where nodes\n"
"connect to strangers is inherently susceptible to Sybil attacks,\n"
"where nodes of typical users are outnumbered by malicious, colluding nodes.\n"
"\n"
"The only way to defend against serious attacks is to *use Freenet in\n"
"Friend-to-Friend mode*, where the precondition to tracking a user is\n"
"social engineering to get the people to whom he/she is connected to\n"
"betray the user. The need to defend against this type of attack is\n"
"the reason why the core of Freenet was rewritten in 2007 to add this\n"
"Friend-to-Friend mode (called Darknet mode).\n"
"\n"
"However the method used by the Missouri police department is using\n"
"false statistics: despite its flaws, Freenet's Opennet is much harder to\n"
"track than they claim.\n"
"\n"
"The Freenet developers do not condemn these attacks. Police departments\n"
"try to use every legal venue to catch criminals. This is their job and\n"
"vocation, but any attack they find could also be used by oppressive\n"
"governments to suppress dissenting opinions, so we will work to fix attacks\n"
"as they come to light.\n"
"We expect law enforcement to get their math right, especially when using\n"
"it in court. If they can get a warrant with an 83% false positive\n"
"rate, that's a problem for lawmakers. If they falsely claim a 0% false\n"
"positive rate, that's eroding the trust of citizens in the legal\n"
"system.\n"
"\n"
"Additional information on this attack is available from the\n"
"[mailing list discussion][mlhtl18].\n"
"\n"
"The mission of the Freenet Project is to safeguard freedom of the\n"
"press by providing censorship resistant communication. This requires\n"
"protecting people against being targeted for what they write or\n"
"read. To achieve this, Freenet enables users to publish anonymous\n"
"websites and offers chat, forums, and file-sharing, as well as\n"
"confidential communication among friends and methods to leverage the\n"
"capabilities of Freenet from other tools.\n"
"\n"
"When the police spread misinformation about the security of Freenet, it\n"
"directly undermines our mission by driving users to networks which\n"
"cannot provide a comparable level of security for\n"
"whistle-blowers and those wishing to publish anonymously."

"This is the last build to support Java 6! The next build will require Java 7 or higher. Nodes running Java 7 or higher and using the official update key will now use a new update key. Nodes on Java 6 remain using the old update key and will not be updated to further builds. Thanks to yadevel for fixing the regression this release was blocking on!\n"
"\n"
"This version was initially partially released as build 1471 - it was released on GitHub but not offered from the website or auto-update. Build 1472 fixes a bug which when using Java 6 prevented nodes from starting for the first time. It did not break existing installations.\n"
"\n"
"Highlights:\n"
"\n"
"- Fix uploads stalling when using MAXIMUM physical security.\n"
"- Fix lots of \"setNativePriority(X) has failed!\", which was caused by a serious thread priority problem. This might fix nodes unexpectedly losing peers.\n"
"- Order alerts within a category by time: if you have lots of messages from darknet peers they will remain nicely sorted.\n"
"- There is now a [caching layer][caching] which should significantly reduce I/O load.\n"
"- Update WebOfTrust from build 15 to build 18. [Its][wot16] [changelogs][wot17] [are][wot18] separate, but the changes reduce CPU load. Incremental score recomputation requires roughly 3 percent of the time of full recomputation, and queuing trust lists to disk lowers thread usage.\n"
"\n"
"Translations:\n"
"\n"
"- Add partial Greek translation.\n"
"- Update German, BokmÃ¥l, Brazilian Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, and  Traditional Chinese translations.\n"
"- Fix BokmÃ¥l localization loading.\n"
"\n"
"Also:\n"
"\n"
"- Remove Gantros Index from the default bookmark list because it stopped updating.\n"
"- Remove Linkageddon from the default bookmark list because it stopped updating.\n"
"- New version of UPnP to fix some instability and compatibility problems. Thanks to 007pig we have a [new UPnP plugin][upnp2] in development which supports UPnP2, but it is not yet included.\n"
"- New version of KeyUtils.\n"
"\n"
"WebOfTrust now has an updatable testing version built and maintained by xor. To use it, unload WebOfTrust, then load \"WebOfTrust Testing Versions\" on the Plugins page. Versions built by xor will not work with Java 6.\n"
"\n"
"Sites can set favicons with `<link rel=\"icon\" type=... href=...>`. (`type` could be `\"image/x-icon\"`)\n"
"\n"
"Extensive review and improvement of English source strings and French and Spanish translations. Tests for and fixes of value substitution in translations. Thanks Vaughan Woodzell!\n"
"\n"
"The default theme is now sky-static instead of clean-dropdown. This looks less outdated, though not modern.\n"
"\n"
"Fix default bookmarks missing the \"software\" category since build 1470. If you don't see this category please re-add the default bookmark set from the bookmark editing page.\n"
"\n"
"IpToCountry database is updated. (This allows providing the country flags on the peers pages. It is local to each instance and does not contact an external service.)\n"

"<b>Important notes</b>: downgrading from build 1468 is not supported; if you want to go back to build 1467 without losing the upload and download queues, <b>before</b> upgrading, back-up the following files and directories: master.keys, persistent-temp-*/, and node.db4o (see https://wiki.freenetproject.org/Program_files ). Please note that running transfers will be restarted from scratch too. A reminder to those testing auto-update to 1468-pre4: please restore your auto-update key to the default. One way to do this is to stop Freenet, remove the \"node.updater.URI\" line from freenet.ini, and start Freenet again.\n"

"\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Existing unfinished downloads and uploads will be imported to a new format, which requires restarting them from the beginning.</li>\n"

"<li>CHKs will change due to metadata bugfixes.</li>\n"
"<li>Some unofficial plugins will need to be updated because of API changes. Sone already works, as do all official plugins.</li>\n"
"<li>The queue format changes should make it extremely rare to lose the entire queue: the impact of corruption will almost always be localized.</li>\n"
"<li>Multi-container / site uploads can now be persistent, making it more practical to upload large sites.</li>\n"
"<li>Passworded physical security is now much stronger. (Full-disk encryption is still preferable.)</li>\n"

This applies to the packages provided by Mempo - other apt-get activity like installing GIMP is still public. It would be possible to host the entire Debian repository in Freenet, but this is not yet on the agenda for Mempo because this other activity does not disclose the potentially sensitive information that you want additional privacy.\n"

"\n"
"*   Add Hungarian Windows installer translation. Thanks drezzium!*   Allow hiding the Java version End Of Life alert. (I'm sorry for the excessive annoyingness. Still - please upgrade Java!)\n"
"*   Upgrades to the next version (that is, when running this build's upgrade code) should no longer get [stuck in an upgrade loop][url_bug3208].\n"
"*   Increase opennet peer limit to 142 peers. This now has [more math behind it][url_peermath] and will change when network parameters are adjusted.\n"
"*   Add more opennet seed nodes. Thanks saces and juiceman!\n"
"*   This build will be mandatory starting 2014-11-16, because old nodes will reject new nodes with more than 110 peers. Updates only take a few hours to spread, so this should only cause short term disruption.\n"

"According to [the press](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/alleged-tor-hidden-service-operator-busted-for-child-porn-distribution/), half of the hidden sites on Tor are now down, apparently connected to the arrest of a man allegedly behind Freedom Hosting, a hosting service for Tor hidden services. Some of these sites were said to offer illegal content and were apparently run by the FBI for two weeks, using a Javascript-based browser exploit to try to find their users.\n"
"\n"
"This has had no effect on Freenet and could not happen on Freenet. Tor hidden services are centralised: A hidden service on Tor is run by a single server somewhere, and if this server is found, the whole site can be shut down, or compromised. In this case half the hidden sites on Tor were run on the same group of servers! See the [Tor blog](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-current-events-and-freedom-hosting) and [mailing list](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2013-August/000089.html).\n"
"\n"
"On Freenet, anything you upload is distributed across the network across thousands of separate nodes all over the world, and will remain available for as long as it remains sufficiently popular: Freenet is a distributed data storage network designed to prevent censorship, provide anonymity and be hard to block. To see more information on the difference between Freenet and Tor, see [our explanation in the FAQ](https://freenetproject.org/faq.html#tor).\n"
"\n"
"Also, the Javascript exploit mentioned would not have worked on Freenet because Freenet removes Javascript by default. The Tor Browser Bundle has an option to block Javascript. We recommend that you enable this if you use Tor.\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, there was no attack against Tor itself: As far as we know, no users of the major \"darknets\" (Freenet, Tor and I2P) has been traced by attacking the networks, by law enforcement or anyone else. In this case, it appears to have been user error, not a problem with Tor itself. Similarly on Freenet, users need to be careful, and Freenet will often tell you when you are about to do something risky.\n"
"\n"
"Having said that, Freenet's security is not perfect, and there are some known (but theoretical) weaknesses, so it might be possible for an attacker with relatively limited resources to trace individual Freenet contributors. Most of Freenet's weaknesses can be addressed by making long-lived connections with people that you trust, i.e. building a friend-to-friend \"darknet\". This functionality is already a part of the regular Freenet software, but we need more users who use Freenet in friend-to-friend mode to improve anonymity.\n"
"\n"
"We have planned further improvements, which should greatly improve security (censorship resistance, anonymity and resistance to blocking), speed and usability. The expanding online surveillance from both governments (e.g. PRISM) and private corporations clearly show that tools such as Freenet, TOR and I2P are essential for a healthy democracy.\n"
"\n"
"Please help us secure freedom of access to information by contributing to the Freenet-project with code, donations, translations, or just by running a node or creating content (anonymously)!\n"
"\n"
"Volunteers - especially developers - are always very welcome. Feel free to contact us, through [IRC online chat](help.html#irc), [the mailing lists](help.html#mailing-lists), or on Freenet itself in the \"freenet\" board on FMS.\n"

Build 1411, which was released on the 3rd of September, makes their main attack largely impractical. Nonetheless, we are working on improvements to both make this attack harder and to solve some of the [other known attacks](https://freenetproject.org/faq.html#attack).

"Finally, the long term solution is to build a darknet, a Freenet network where people only connect directly to people they trust. That means, get your friends using Freenet, and then add them as Friends on your node. When enough people use Freenet and form darknet connections, we won't need opennet, and this makes all attacks dramatically harder. We will work on making this easier and faster in the near future, as well as fixing the Pitch Black attack."
